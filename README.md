Hi, I’m @jsonetbet I’m interested in embracing technology by having, at least some, control over the devices I own.
I’m currently learning how to create a README .md file(sorry), base basics, python, networking concepts but not following a course outline so find myself learning piecemeal.....
I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help build something where I can be of use.
I will post contact info when I find something I feel is private. 
THANKYOU github .com
