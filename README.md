Hi, I’m @jsonetbet I’m interested in embracing technology by having, at least some, control over the devices I own.
I’m currently learning how to create a README .md file(sorry), BASH, Python, networking concepts. as I'm not following a course outline I'm learning piecemeal..... Structure needed.
I’m looking to collaborate on anything that I can help out with. 
I will post contact info when I find something I feel is private. 
THANKYOU github .com
